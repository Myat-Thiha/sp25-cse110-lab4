1. line 9 prints values added: 20 since add is true and the if block runs. 

2. Line 13 prints 20 because result is var and var is function-scoped so it can be accessed throughout the function regardless of the block in which it is defined. 

3. We should not use var because variables declared with var are visible throughout the entire function, even outside the block they're defined in.

4. line 9 prints values added: 20

5. line 14 return the error because let is declared within the if block and cannot be accessed outside of the block.

6. line 9 returns an error because we are modifying the vairable that is const and const variables cannot be modified after definition.
